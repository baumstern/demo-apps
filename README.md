# Hypercert demo apps

⚠️ This repository is under development. We decided to publish this in advance to give other developers started repositories

## Demo apps

To assist developers with integrating hypercers in their application we provide the [Hypercerts SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hypercerts-org/hypercerts-sdk). Since there's a multitude of tools, setups, packaging methods, etc, we expose an opiniated set of demo applications to get you started. 

Unfortunately, there's no silver bullet when working with web apps but the applications and configurations in this repository should point developers in the right direction.
